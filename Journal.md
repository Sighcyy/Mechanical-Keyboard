Today, I started taking the first steps to advance to the next level in my keyboard journey. I started with a MacPad, but I did not use a matrix since I only had a few numbers of keys. Thus, my next project was going to be a Mechanical Keyboard.

Today, I conducted research and completed some overall planning for my project. With the matrix design, I had to take into account "ghosting", which I could easily avoid with some diodes. 

I did a couple of whiteboard drawings just to understand how many columns and rows I would need. Then I created my schematic based on my whiteboard drawing reference.

I then went into what each key would represent so that I could get a better understanding of what the keyboard key layout would be like.

By doing this, I was able to remove some extra columns so that my keyboard would be much more portable.

Afterwards, I spent the rest of my time choosing the right footprints and placing all my parts properly on the PCB
