Today, I took the first step to advance to the next level in my keyboard journey. I started with a MacPad, but I did not use a matrix since I only had a few keys. Thus, my next project was going to be a Mechanical Keyboard.

Today, I conducted research and completed some overall planning for my project. With the matrix design, I had to take into account "ghosting", which I could easily avoid with some diodes. 

I did a couple of whiteboard drawings just to understand how many columns and rows I would need. Then I created my schematic based on my whiteboard drawing reference.

I then went into what each key would represent so that I could get a better understanding of what the keyboard key layout would be like.

By doing this, I was able to remove some extra columns so that my keyboard would be much more portable.

Afterwards, I spent the rest of my time choosing the right footprints and placing all my parts properly on the PCB

I spent a lot of time today trying to understand just exactly how I could route every input. It took a lot of time, but I looked into using the back-end copper layers and the vias. This helped a lot, and I was able to finish making the PCB much faster. On top of all that, I learned more shortcuts on how to speed up my future PCB designing process.

Today was a very fast day on the 3D Modeling side. I finished up the CAD model by making a top and bottom plate, similar to how I made my MacPad. I had to use a keyboard layout editor and import it as a DFX in order to cut out the right holes into the top plate. Right now, it's missing some aesthetic to appeal to users, but I thought it would be better to approach that near the end. Instead, I focused on researching how the code would be created.

I finished writing my code in Python KMK. It was very fast because I did my research the day before on how to insert diodes into the code and a rotary encoder. Since I was also technically finished, I thought I'd spend some time in order to add some more designs to my keyboard case. Mostly inscriptions, and some linings just to make it nice.
